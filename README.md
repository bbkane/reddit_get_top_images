**Here is a typical API usecase that will get all the top images of
www.reddit.com/r/getmotivated from last week.**

```py

import get_top_images as gi

sub_reddit = 'getmotivated'
tir = gi.TopImageRetreiver(sub_reddit, limit=5)
for url in tir.get_top_submissions():
    gi.download_it(url, tir)
```

**Here is a typical CLI usecase that will do the same:**


```bash
$ python get_top_images.py -s getmotivated -p w
